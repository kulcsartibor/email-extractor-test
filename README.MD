# Simple Email extractor service
The library contains a single Service which can extract emails from a given text. The service is implemented in Java.

## How to use
The library is built with Gradle. Testing is done in JUnit 5.

1. The text report is automatically generated by the Gradle build process. The report is located in the build/reports/tests/test/index.html file.
Use `gradlew test` to run the tests and generate the report.
2. The test report can be automatically archived by the Gradle build process. The report is located in the build/reports/tests/test/index.html file.
Use `gradlew copyTestReport` to copy the test report into the archive directory. This task will automatically run the tests also, no need to execure both.

The difference between the two tasks is that the first one will run the tests and generate the report, while the second one will execute the test and 
copy the report into the archive directory.
